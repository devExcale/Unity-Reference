# Assets

Asset is the general name which indicates any type of resource, such as [sprites](/Assets/Sprites.md), [prefabs](/Assets/Prefabs.md) and even [scripts](/Coding/Scripts.md), which can be used in the game.

Assets are collected under an `Assets` folder, which will contain almost every file the game needs.
