# Unity Reference

This is an [obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md/) containing my notes about [Unity](https://unity.com). This is NOT a guide, it's only a repository of notes where I keep my ideas, findings and understandings of unity development.

If you happen to find anything wrong in the notes and would like to contribute, make a pull request and I'll make sure to review it!

The whole repository is viewable through *GitHub*, but for the best experience  (e.g. *plugins*) Obsidian is recommended.
