# Project Design

A project prototype needs to have well defined ideas from the get-go, or else development won't flow well. Clear ideas help set up a good foundation for the whole game.

Project Design is a tool to help with defining a game's prototype (rough) characteristics in all the stages. Moreover, it can help estimate the prototype's develop time.
